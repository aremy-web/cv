              The objective of the bikehiremalaga.es project was to develop a website that would increase online bookings for a bike rental company based in Malaga, Spain. 
              The website was designed to be simple, elegant, and informative, with a focus on providing a seamless user experience for customers who are interested in renting bikes in Malaga.
              <br><br>
              The project involved a variety of languages and technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API integration. Here's a breakdown of the work done in each stage:
              <ul>
                <li><strong>User Personas & keyword research:</strong> The project began with the creation of user personas that represent the target audience for the website. 
                  I conducted keyword research to identify the search terms that potential customers would use to find the website.</li>
                <li><strong>Data analysis:</strong> I analyzed the data collected from the user personas and keyword research to determine the best strategies for marketing the website, including SEO, 
                  social media, and other marketing channels.</li>
                <li><strong>UX & UI design:</strong> I created wireframes and designs for the website, focusing on creating a simple, elegant, and informative user experience. 
                  I also created a responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices, incorporating the company's branding and style guidelines.</li>
                <li><strong>Frontend development:</strong> I developed the frontend of the website using Bootstrap 4. I optimized the site for speed and performance, ensuring that it loads quickly and works smoothly for users.</li>
                <li><strong>API integration:</strong> I integrated the website with third-party APIs that enable online booking and payment processing. 
                  This involved working with the APIs to ensure that they functioned properly and integrated seamlessly with the website.</li>
                <li><strong>Manual QA:</strong> I performed manual QA testing to ensure that the website worked properly and was free of bugs and errors. 
                  I also tested the site on multiple devices and browsers to ensure that it worked seamlessly for all users.</li>
                <li><strong>Maintenance & version updates:</strong> I continued to maintain the website, making regular updates to ensure that it remained up-to-date and functional. 
                  I also made version updates as needed, incorporating new features and functionality as the business evolved.</li>
                <li><strong>User testing:</strong> I conducted surveys and user interview to ensure an optimum usability.</li>
                <li><strong>Data analysis:</strong> I compared the data before/after deployement to optimise the next interation.</li>
              </ul>
            
              Overall, the bikehiremalaga.es project was a success, providing the bike rental company with a modern, user-friendly website that has helped to increase online bookings and grow the business.
