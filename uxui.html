              <h3>UX | UI design</h3>
              <p>As an experienced UX UI designer, I have a diverse range of skills and expertise. 
                Throughout my career, I have worked on various projects, including those related to eCommerce, medicine, tourism, eco-transportation, and both B2C and B2B markets.
                As a Data-informed UX designer, I leveraged data insights to create effective and efficient user experiences. 
                <br><br>
                My previous experience as a frontend designer, helps me communicate effectively with technical teams. 
                Over time, I have developed a strong understanding of the technical side of the design process and work closely with engineering teams to ensure seamless collaboration 
                and efficient project delivery. I have experience working within a Scrum/Agile framework, which has further helped me optimize the design process. 
                <br><br>
                Currently, I am focusing on B2B-directed software interface design, following the design process, UX laws, and usability principles. 
                I aim to create intuitive and engaging designs that meet the needs of end-users and contribute to the success of businesses.
                <br><br>
                I also have experience working with a wide range of tools, methodes, languages, and technologies. Some of the tools, languages, and technologies that I have experience working with include:
                <ul class="special-list">
                  <li><i class="bi-bullseye"></i>  Design and prototyping tools either with Figma, or Adobe XD</li>
                  <li><i class="bi-bullseye"></i> Frontend development languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
                  <li><i class="bi-bullseye"></i> Design systems and component libraries such as Next.js and Bootstrap</li>
                  <li><i class="bi-bullseye"></i> Agile project management tools such as Jira</li>
                  <li><i class="bi-bullseye"></i> Conduct user research and testing using various methods such as surveys, field studies, moderated and unmoderated user testing.</li>
                </ul>
                My ultimate goal is to create designs that not only provide value to users and help businesses achieve their goals, but also meet the unique needs and specifications of each project.
